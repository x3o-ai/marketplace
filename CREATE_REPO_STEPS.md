# Create Fresh GitHub Repository

## ❌ Current Issue
Repository not found - you need to create it on GitHub first.

## 🆕 Create New Repository

### Step 1: Go to GitHub
1. Open browser: https://github.com/epicmotionSD
2. Click the green "New" button (or "+" → "New repository")

### Step 2: Fill Repository Details
- **Repository name**: `x3o-marketplace`
- **Description**: `x3o.ai - Complete Trinity Agent marketplace with dramatic intensity design system and automation urgency messaging`
- **Visibility**: ✅ Public
- **Initialize**: 
  - ❌ Do NOT add README file

  - ❌ Do NOT add license
- Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd x3o-marketplace

# Verify remote is correct
git remote -v

# If remote is wrong, fix it:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/epicmotionSD/x3o-marketplace.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🚀 Alternative: One-Command Setup
If you want to use a different repository name or account:

```bash
cd x3o-marketplace

# Remove current remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote (change URL as needed)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```
