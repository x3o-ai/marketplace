# GitHub Permission Issue Fix

## ‚ùå Current Issue
Permission denied to push to `x3o-ai/marketplace` - you don't have access to this organization.

## üîß Solution Options

### Option 1: Create Under Your Personal Account (Recommended)
```bash
cd x3o-marketplace

# Remove the current origin
git remote remove origin

# Add your personal repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/epicmotionSD/x3o-marketplace.git

# Push to your account
git push -u origin main
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://github.com/epicmotionSD
2. Create new repository: `x3o-marketplace`
3. Make it public
4. Description: "x3o.ai - Complete Trinity Agent marketplace with dramatic intensity design system"
5. Run the commands above

### Option 2: Get Access to x3o-ai Organization
If you own the `x3o-ai` organization:
1. Go to https://github.com/orgs/x3o-ai/people
2. Make sure your account `epicmotionSD` is an owner/admin
3. Or invite yourself with admin permissions

### Option 3: Fork and Transfer Later
1. Create under your personal account first
2. Deploy and test
3. Transfer to organization later when you have permissions

## üöÄ Quick Fix (Personal Account)
Create repository at: https://github.com/epicmotionSD/x3o-marketplace

Then run:
```bash
cd x3o-marketplace
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/epicmotionSD/x3o-marketplace.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ‚úÖ After Success
Your x3o.ai marketplace will be live at:
- Repository: https://github.com/epicmotionSD/x3o-marketplace
- GitHub Pages: https://epicmotionSD.github.io/x3o-marketplace/
- Custom domain can point to this deployment
